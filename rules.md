# Introduction

You are one of the Colossi who rules over this dangerous island. Your goal is to prove your might and become the most renown Colossus. As a Colossus, you will create new Acolytes to do your bidding, control territory around the island, and collect Gold and Cards. But beware: Colossi also control Beasts, and will kill your Acolytes in a heartbeat. Prove yourself to the gods by outwitting the other Colossi, controlling Environments, and achieving one of the 3 victory conditions.
 
# Components

## Board 
The island has 27 spaces. The island starts empty, but will eventually be filled with Loot Tokens and Environments.

## Colossi
You are a Colossus, and you lead a fleet of Acolytes.  Colossi cannot die, and remain on the island for the entire game.

## Acolytes
Acolytes move like Colossi, but die frequently. 
- Any time an Acolyte is pushed off the edge of the island, it dies.
- Lots of cards, Beasts, and other things will kill your Acolytes.
- When your Acolytes die, they return to your hand, and can be played again on future turns.

## Beasts
Beasts are monsters who haunt this island. Each has a passive effect and a special Lair Environment that causes a big action. In each game, you will play with 2 randomly selected Beasts.

## Gold
If you collect 30 Gold, the game ends and you immediately win. Gain gold from cards and by scoring your Banners to claim the rewards from Environmnets and Loot.

## Banners
Banners indicate which player will collect rewards for a given space.
- You can raise your Banners at the end of your turn on spaces you Control. There can only be 1 Banner on a given space. If there was an opposing Banner on the space where you raised one, return it to its owner's hand.
- Even if you move your Acolytes and Colossus off of that space, and another player Controls it, your Banner remains until they replace it or you Rest.
- If you have no Banners in your hand, you cannot play anymore Banners. You cannot move Banners already in play.
- When you Rest, you will collect rewards for each of your Banners, and return them to your hand. You can reuse Banners after they return to your hand. Sometimes there will be Gold on spaces (not just Loot Tokens); in these cases, keep the Gold on the space you're scoring.

## Environments
Environments are special tiles with potentially big rewards. Raise one of your Banners on a Environment to claim its rewards when you Rest. 16 of these tiles are just Grass, which have no special effects.

## Loot Tokens
Loot gives you smaller rewards. Loot tokens remain in play, and can be used on every turn. There are Loot tokens that give you Colossus Cards and Gold when you Rest. Raise one of your Banners on a space with a Loot Token to claim its rewards when collecting your Banners.

Types of Loot: 
- **Gold**: Some Loot Tokens give you Gold. The amount of Gold they give you is specified on the Token. Gold Tokens with the die symbol mean that you roll the die and receive that much Gold.
- **Cards**: These Loot Tokens specify how many cards you get to draw from the deck.
- **Favor**: These give you 1 Favor. Collect 5 Favor to win the game.

## Colossus Cards
Colossus Cards allow you to get Gold, move Acolytes around, and gain advantages over opponents. You have a hand limit of 6 Cards including Colossus Cards and Beast Cards. There are 4 types of Colossus Card:

- **Action**: Move pieces around the board, get more cards, and more.
- **Perk**: Gain a persistent advantage over other players. Perks stay in front of you, face-up for ongoing use. You may only have 1 Perk active at a time. 
- **Divine Gift**: Reward Colossi based on their position. These gifts go to all Colossi, so good timing is crucial.
- **Beast**: Control Beast movement.
- **Favor**: Each Favor has a unique cost, but allows you to gain Favor. Gain 5 Favor and you win the game.

# Setup

- Each player chooses a color, and receives a set of 1 Starting Environment tile, 1 Colossus, 6 Banners, and 10 Acolytes of that color 
- Shuffle the Colossus Card deck and place it near the board. Deal each player 3 Colossus Cards.
- Beginning with the first player, take turns placing your Starting Environment tiles on any unoccupied space you choose. Place your Colossus on your Starting Environment Tile, and place a Loot Token of 1 Gold on this space.
- Set aside 16 Grass Tiles face-down. Shuffle the Lair tiles and put 2 face-down with the Grass tiles. Shuffle the rest of the Environment Tiles, draw 8 and put them face-down with the 18 other tiles. Shuffle these 26 Tiles and keep them face-down. Return all other Environments and Lairs back to the box.
- Shuffle all Loot Tokens and place them face-down.
- Place all Colossi in the center space, and place a random Loot Token there.
- Determine a first player. 

# Gameplay

Colossi's gameplay simply consists of player turns. Continue taking turns until any player has reached one of the 3 victory conditions.

## Colossus Turn

### Action Phase
1. Draw 1 Colossus Card.
2. Take 4 Actions. With your Action, you may either play a Colossus card, or move (see full Movement rules in the next section).
3. You may move each Beast 1 space.

### Banner Phase

Then, you will do one (but not both) of the following:

1. **Deploy**: You may place Banners from your hand on any spaces you Control. If you place a Banner on a space containing an opposing Banner, return it to its owner's hand. You may also move your deployed Banners to other spaces you control.

2. **Rest**: Collect each of your deployed Banners, in any order you choose. Each time you collect a Banner, collect the reward for that space or activate its Environment effect. If there is Gold on the space you're scoring, keep that Gold.

## Game End

There are 3 ways to win the game. If you achieve any of the following, the game ends immediately and you win: 

- **Hegemon**: You have 30 Gold.
- **Ascendant**: You have 5 Favor.
- **Crusader**: You kill 20 opposing Acolytes.

# Movement
You have 4 Actions on your turn, and it costs 1 Action to move your Colossus or an Acolyte 1 space in any direction. Colossi and Acolytes follow the same rules for movement.
- **Exploring**: When moving into a space that has no Loot Token or Environment, you will discover what is there. Draw an Environment tile from the deck you built during Setup. If it is Grass, put a Loot Token there. If it is a Beast Lair, immediately put the corrosponding Beast on that space.
- **Road Movement**: When moving into a space that already contains your Colossus or one of your Acolytes, you may continue onward to any adjacent space for free. If you have your Colossus or Acolytes in multiple adjacent spaces, move long distances using just 1 Movement.
- **Spawn an Acolyte**: For the cost of 1 Movement, place an Acolyte from your hand onto your Colossus’s space. You may immediately move that Acolyte to an adjacent space for free using Road Movement.

# Control
You must control spaces in order to raise your Banners. How do you control a space?

| # of Colossi on the space| Who controls the space (in case of a tie, neither player has control) |
|----------|----------|
| No Colossus  | The player with the most Acolytes on the space. | 
| 1 Colossus   | The Colossus supersedes all Acolytes. | 
| Multiple Colossi   | The Colossus on the space who has the most Acolytes on the space. |
