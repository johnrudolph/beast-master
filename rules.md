# Introduction

You are 1 of the Colossi who rules over this dangerous island. Your goal is to prove your might and become the most renown Colossus. As a Colossus, you will create new Acolytes to do your bidding, control territory around the island, and collect Gold and Cards. But beware: Colossi also control Beasts, and will kill your Acolytes in a heartbeat. Prove yourself to the gods by outwitting the other Colossi, controlling Environments, and reaching 50 Gold before your opponents.
 
# Components

## Board 
The island has 27 spaces. The island starts empty, but will eventually be filled with Loot and varied environments.

## Colossi
You are a Colossus, and you lead a fleet of Acolytes.  Colossi cannot die, and remain on the island for the entire game.

## Acolytes
Acolytes move like Colossi, but die frequently. 
- Any time an Acolyte is pushed off the edge of the island, it dies.
- Lots of cards, Beasts, and other things will kill your Acolytes.
- When your Acolytes die, they return to your hand, and can be played again on future turns.

## Beasts
Beasts are monsters who haunt this island. Each has a passive effect and a special Lair Environment that causes a big action. In each game, you will play with 2 randomly selected Beasts.

## Gold
If you collect 50 Gold, the game ends and you immediately win. Gain Gold from cards and by harvesting spaces to claim the rewards from Environments, Loot, and Gold cubes.

## Environments
Environments are special tiles with potentially big rewards. Control an Environment at Harvest to claim its rewards. 

## Loot 
Loot gives you smaller rewards. Harvest a space with Loot to claim its rewards. 

Types of Loot: 
- **Gold**: For each golden Loot, collect 1 Gold.
- **Cards**: For each blue Loot, draw 1 Colossus Card.
- **Traits**: For each green Loot, gain 1 Trait. 

Note: Loot is different from special environments. Some cards and Beasts will grant your rewards related to Loot. Those rewards do not apply to special environments.

## Water tiles
These tiles are essentially empty spaces, and you treat them just like you treat the borders of the board. Colossi, and Beasts cannot move onto them. If Acolytes are pushed onto them, they die. Each Epoch will instruct you where to place Water tiles, and these can shift throughtout the game.

## Gold cubes
Some Environments and Beasts will leave Gold cubes on the board. If you Harvest a space with Gold cubes, you will collect them. Gain a Gold on the score tracker, and return the Gold cubes to the bank.

## Colossus Cards
Colossus Cards allow you to get Gold, move Acolytes around, and gain advantages over opponents. You have a hand limit of 6 Cards, and must immediately discard down to 6 if you ever have more. There are 4 types of Colossus Card:

- **Action**: Move pieces around the board, get more cards, and more.
- **Beast**: Control Beast movement.
- **Curse**: Each Curse hurts you, but also grants you Gold.
- **Divine Gift**: Reward Colossi based on their position. These gifts go to all Colossi, so good timing is crucial.

## Traits
Traits are cards that give your Colossus a boost. You can only have 2 Traits in play at a time. You may discard one of your Traits at any time. At any given time there will be 3 face-up Traits and a Trait deck. When you select a Trait, you may draw from the deck, or choose 1 of the face-up Traits. If you choose a face-up Trait, replace it with another face-up Trait from the deck before the next player chooses. Traits continually give your Colossus a boost. 

Designer note: For your first game, do not play with Traits. They make the game much more interesting, but it's best to learn the basics without them.

# Setup

- Each player chooses a color, and receives a set of 1 Colossus and 10 Acolytes of that color. 
- Shuffle the Colossus Card deck and place it near the board. Deal each player 3 Colossus Cards.
- Set aside 16 Grass Tiles face-down. Shuffle the Lair tiles and put 2 face-down with the Grass tiles. Shuffle the remainder of the Environment Tiles, draw 8 and put them face-down with the 18 other tiles. Shuffle these 26 Tiles and keep them face-down. Return all other Environments and Lairs back to the box.
- Determine a first player. 
- Place a random tile face-up in the center of the board. Place all Colossi on that tile.

**If this is your first game, skip the following step.**
- Shuffle the Trait deck, and lay out 3 face-up. Take turns selecting either a face-up Trait, or the top card of the Trait deck. If you take a face-up Trait, replace it with another face-up Trait from the deck before the next player chooses. Once each player has a Trait, leave 3 face-up Traits beside the Trait deck.

# Gameplay

Colossi's gameplay simply consists of player turns. Continue taking turns until any player has reached 1 of the 3 victory conditions.

## Colossus Turn

### Action Phase
1. **Draw**: Draw 1 Colossus Card.
2. **Actions**: Take 4 Actions. With your Action, you may either play a Colossus card, or move (see full Movement rules in the next section).
3. **Move Beast**: You may move a Beast 1 space.

## Game End

The game ends when any player has 50 Gold. Each player must take an equal number of turns. So once a player reaches 50, continue taking turns until you reach the player who took the first turn of the game.

# Movement
You have 4 Actions on your turn, and it costs 1 Action to move your Colossus or an Acolyte 1 space in any direction. Colossi and Acolytes follow the same rules for movement.
- **Exploring**: When moving into a space that has no tile on it, you will discover what is there. Draw an Environment tile from the deck you built during Setup. If it is a Beast Lair, immediately put the corrosponding Beast on that space.
- **Road Movement**: When moving into a space that already contains your Colossus or 1 of your Acolytes, you may continue onward to any adjacent space for free. If you have your Colossus or Acolytes in multiple adjacent spaces, move long distances using just 1 Movement.
- **Spawn an Acolyte**: For the cost of 1 Movement, place an Acolyte from your hand onto your Colossus’s space. You may immediately move that Acolyte to an adjacent space for free using Road Movement.

# Control
You must control spaces in order to harvest them at the end of each Epoch. How do you control a space?

| # of Colossi on the space| Who controls the space (in case of a tie, neither player has control) |
|----------|----------|
| No Colossus  | The player with the most Acolytes on the space. | 
| 1 Colossus   | The Colossus supersedes all Acolytes. | 
| Multiple Colossi   | The Colossus on the space who has the most Acolytes on the space. | 

# Frequently Asked Questions

Q: **I have two cards that have conflicting effects. What do I do?**
A: There may be cases where you have a Curse that limits how many Acolytes you can have in play, and also a Trait that limits how many Acolytes you can have in play. In these cases, always choose the lower limit.
