# Introduction

You are 1 of the Colossi who rules over this dangerous island. Your goal is to prove your might and become the most renown Colossus. As a Colossus, you will create new Acolytes to do your bidding, control territory around the island, and collect Gold and Cards. But beware: Colossi also control Beasts, and will kill your Acolytes in a heartbeat. Prove yourself to the gods by outwitting the other Colossi, controlling Environments, and reaching 50 Gold before your opponents.
 
# Components

## Board 
The island has 27 spaces. The island starts empty, but will eventually be filled with Loot and varied environments.

## Colossi
You are a Colossus, and you lead a fleet of Acolytes.  Colossi cannot die, and remain on the island for the entire game.

## Acolytes
Acolytes move like Colossi, but die frequently. 
- Any time an Acolyte is pushed off the edge of the island, it dies.
- Lots of cards, Beasts, and other things will kill your Acolytes.
- When your Acolytes die, they return to your hand, and can be played again on future turns.

## Beasts
Beasts are monsters who haunt this island. Each has a passive effect and a special Lair Environment that causes a big action. In each game, you will play with 2 randomly selected Beasts.

## Gold
If you collect 50 Gold, the game ends and you immediately win. Gain gold from cards and by scoring your Banners to claim the rewards from Environmnets and Loot cubes.

## Banners
Banners indicate which player will collect rewards for a given space.
- You can raise your Banners at the end of your turn on spaces you Control. There can only be 1 Banner on a given space. If there was an opponent's Banner on the space where you raised one, return it to its owner's hand.
- Even if you move your Acolytes and Colossus off of that space, and another player Controls it, your Banner remains until they replace it or you Rest.
- If you have no Banners in your hand, you cannot play anymore Banners. You cannot move Banners already in play.
- When you Rest, you will collect rewards for each of your Banners, and return them to your hand. Collect any Loot cubes on the space you're scoring, and activate any Environment effects. You can reuse Banners after they return to your hand. 

## Environments
Environments are special tiles with potentially big rewards. Raise 1 of your Banners on a Environment to claim its rewards when you Rest. 16 of these tiles are just Grass, which have no special effects.

## Loot cubes
Loot gives you smaller rewards. Score 1 of your Banners on a space with Loot cubes to claim their rewards. 

Types of Loot: 
- **Gold**: For each golden Loot cube, collect 1 Gold.
- **Cards**: For each blue Loot cube, draw 1 Colossus Card.
- **Traits**: For each green Loot cube, gain 1 Trait. Traits continually give your Colossus a boost. You can only have 2 Traits at a time. Choose 1 of the 3 face-up Traits, or the top Trait from the Trait deck. There should always be 3 face-up Traits. You can only have 2 Traits at a time, so if you gain a third, you must immediately discard 1 of them. Keep a separate discard pile for Traits.

## Colossus Cards
Colossus Cards allow you to get Gold, move Acolytes around, and gain advantages over opponents. You have a hand limit of 6 Cards including Colossus Cards and Beast Cards. There are 4 types of Colossus Card:

- **Action**: Move pieces around the board, get more cards, and more.
- **Beast**: Control Beast movement.
- **Curse**: Each Curse hurts you, but also grants you Gold.
- **Divine Gift**: Reward Colossi based on their position. These gifts go to all Colossi, so good timing is crucial.

## Traits
Traits are cards that give your Colossus a boost. You can only have 2 Traits in play at a time. At any given time there will be 3 face-up Traits and a Trait deck. When you select a Trait, you may draw from the deck, or choose 1 of the face-up Traits. If you choose a face-up Trait, replace it with another face-up Trait from the deck before the next player chooses. 

Designer note: For your first game, do not play with Traits. They make the game much more interesting, but it's best to learn the basics without them.

# Setup

- Each player chooses a color, and receives a set of 1 Starting Environment tile, 1 Colossus, 6 Banners, and 10 Acolytes of that color. 
- Shuffle the Trait deck, and lay out 3 face-up. Take turns selecting either a face-up Trait, or the top card of the Trait deck. If you take a face-up Trait, replace it with another face-up Trait from the deck before the next player chooses. Once each player has a Trait, leave 3 face-up Traits beside the Trait deck.
- Shuffle the Colossus Card deck and place it near the board. Deal each player 3 Colossus Cards.
- Beginning with the first player, take turns placing your Starting Environment tiles on any unoccupied space you choose. Place your Colossus on your Starting Environment Tile, and place the corresponding Loot cubes on that space.
- Set aside 16 Grass Tiles face-down. Shuffle the Lair tiles and put 2 face-down with the Grass tiles. Shuffle the rest of the Environment Tiles, draw 8 and put them face-down with the 18 other tiles. Shuffle these 26 Tiles and keep them face-down. Return all other Environments and Lairs back to the box.
- Determine a first player. 

# Gameplay

Colossi's gameplay simply consists of player turns. Continue taking turns until any player has reached 1 of the 3 victory conditions.

## Colossus Turn

### Action Phase
1. **Replenish**: For any tile that produces Loot cubes, but currently has no Loot cubes on it, place corresponding Loot cubes on it. 
2. **Draw**: Draw 1 Colossus Card.
3. **Actions**: Take 4 Actions. With your Action, you may either play a Colossus card, or move (see full Movement rules in the next section).
4. **Move Beast**: You may move a Beast 1 space.

### Banner Phase

Then, you will do 1 (but not both) of the following:

1. **Deploy**: You may place Banners from your hand on any spaces you Control. If you place a Banner on a space containing an opponent's Banner, return it to its owner's hand. You may also move your deployed Banners to other spaces you control.

2. **Rest**: Collect each of your deployed Banners, in any order you choose. Each time you collect a Banner, collect the reward for that space or activate its Environment effect. If there is Gold on the space you're scoring, keep that Gold.

## Game End

The game ends when any player has 50 Gold. Each player must take an equal number of turns. So once a player reaches 50, continue taking turns until you reach the player who took the first turn of the game.

# Movement
You have 4 Actions on your turn, and it costs 1 Action to move your Colossus or an Acolyte 1 space in any direction. Colossi and Acolytes follow the same rules for movement.
- **Exploring**: When moving into a space that has no tile on it, you will discover what is there. Draw an Environment tile from the deck you built during Setup. If it is a Beast Lair, immediately put the corrosponding Beast on that space.
- **Road Movement**: When moving into a space that already contains your Colossus or 1 of your Acolytes, you may continue onward to any adjacent space for free. If you have your Colossus or Acolytes in multiple adjacent spaces, move long distances using just 1 Movement.
- **Spawn an Acolyte**: For the cost of 1 Movement, place an Acolyte from your hand onto your Colossus’s space. You may immediately move that Acolyte to an adjacent space for free using Road Movement.

# Control
You must control spaces in order to raise your Banners. How do you control a space?

| # of Colossi on the space| Who controls the space (in case of a tie, neither player has control) |
|----------|----------|
| No Colossus  | The player with the most Acolytes on the space. | 
| 1 Colossus   | The Colossus supersedes all Acolytes. | 
| Multiple Colossi   | The Colossus on the space who has the most Acolytes on the space. | 

# Frequently Asked Questions

Q: **I have two cards that have conflicting effects. What do I do?**
A: There may be cases where you have a Curse that limits how many Acolytes you can have in play, and also a Trait that limits how many Acolytes you can have in play. In these cases, always choose the lower limit.
