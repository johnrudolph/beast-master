# Introduction

You are one of the Colossi who seeks to rule over this dangerous island. Your goal is to prove your might and become the most renown Colossus. As a Colossus, you will create new Acolytes to do your bidding, control territory around the island, and gain Gold and Cards. But beware: Colossi also control Beasts, and will kill your Acolytes in a heartbeat. Outsmart and overpower your opponents over the course of 3 Ages to become the most renown Colossus.
 
# Components

## Board 
The island has 27 spaces. The island starts empty, but will eventually be filled with tiles that grant you rewards at Reap.

## Colossi
You are a Colossus, and you lead a fleet of Acolytes.  Colossi cannot die, and remain on the island for the entire game.

## Acolytes
Acolytes move like Colossi, but die frequently. 
- Any time an Acolyte is pushed off the edge of the island, it dies. Some cards, Beasts, and tiles will kill your Acolytes.
- When your Acolytes die, they return to your hand, and can be played again on future turns.

## Beasts
Beasts are monsters who haunt this island. Each has a passive effect, and a Reap effect. When you Reap a space that contains a Beast, you trigger its Reap effect. 

## Gold
The player with the most Gold at the end of the game wins. Track how much Gold you have on the Gold tracker. Gain Gold from cards and by Reaping spaces to claim the rewards from Environments, Loot, and Gold cubes. Any time you gain or lose Gold, update the Gold tracker.

## Environments
Environments are special tiles with potentially big rewards. Control an Environment at Reap to claim its rewards. There are two types of Environment effects: 
1. Arrival: these effects happen when an Acolyte or Colossus moves onto the space.
2. Reap: these effects happen when reaping the space. 

## Grass tiles
Grass tiles simply grant you rewards at Reap. Control a Grass tile to claim its rewards. 

Types of Loot on Grass tiles: 
- **Gold**: gain 1 Gold.
- **Cards**: draw 1 Colossus Card.
- **Traits**: gain 1 Trait. 

## Water tiles
These tiles are essentially empty spaces, and you treat them just like you treat the borders of the board. Colossi, and Beasts cannot move onto them. If Acolytes are pushed onto them, they die. Each Age will instruct you where to place Water tiles, and these can shift throughtout the game.

## Gold cubes
Some Environments and Beasts will leave Gold cubes on the board. If you Reap a space with Gold cubes, you will gain them. Gain a Gold on the Gold tracker, and return the Gold cubes to the bank.

## Colossus Cards
Colossus Cards allow you to get Gold, move Acolytes around, and gain advantages over opponents. You have a hand limit of 6 Cards, and must immediately discard down to 6 if you ever have more. There are 4 types of Colossus Card:

- **Action**: Move pieces around the board, get more cards, and more.
- **Beast**: Control Beast movement. These also give you +1 Action, and so are essentially free to play.
- **Divine Gift**: Reward Colossi based on their position. These gifts go to all Colossi, so good timing is crucial.

## Age cards
The game takes place over 3 Ages. Each Age comes with a card that includes special scoring at the end of the age, instructions for where to place Water tiles, and other unique events.

## Mantle
The Mantle simply indicates who is the first player for the Age. At the end of each Age, the Mantle goes to the player in first place.

## Traits
Traits are cards that give your Colossus a boost. You can only have 2 Traits in play at a time. You may discard one of your Traits at any time. At any given time there will be 3 face-up Traits and a Trait deck. When you select a Trait, you may draw from the deck, or choose 1 of the face-up Traits. If you choose a face-up Trait, replace it with another face-up Trait from the deck before the next player chooses. Traits continually give your Colossus a boost. 

Designer note: For your first game, do not play with Traits. They make the game much more interesting, but it's best to learn the basics without them.

# Setup

- If you are playing with 2 or 3 players, use water tiles to shrink the board as shown in the diagram.
- Shuffle the Age decks, and draw an Age card for Ages I, II, and III. Set them face-down at the top of the board. Reveal Age I, locate its Beasts, and place them on the spaces indicated on the Age card. 
- Each player chooses a color, and receives a set of 1 Colossus and 10 Acolytes of that color. 
- Shuffle the Colossus Card deck and place it near the board. Deal each player 2 Colossus Cards.
- Shuffle all environment tiles to form the face-down Environment deck.
- Determine which player has played this game the most, and give them the Mantle.
- Place a random tile face-up in the center of the board. Place all Colossi on that tile.

**If this is your first game, skip the following step.**
- Shuffle the Trait deck, and lay out 3 face-up. Take turns selecting either a face-up Trait, or the top card of the Trait deck. If you take a face-up Trait, replace it with another face-up Trait from the deck before the next player chooses. Once each player has a Trait, leave 3 face-up Traits beside the Trait deck.

# Gameplay

Each Age has two phases: Action Phase and Reap Phase.

## Action Phase
The Action Phase simply consists of player turns. On your turn, you will do the following in order:

1. **Actions**: Take 4 Actions. With your Action, you may either play a Colossus card, or move your Colossus or an Acolyte (see full Movement rules in the next section). Some cards will give you extra Actions. When you play those cards, use those extra Actions immediately on this turn.
2. **Draw**: Draw 1 Colossus Card.

## Reap Phase
The Reap Phase is where you gain rewards from the board. This happens at the end of each Age. First, read the special scoring instructions on the Age card. Distribute rewards as instructed.

Then, beginning with the player with the Mantle, take turns Reaping. On your turn, you will Reap just one space that you control. If you do not control any spaces, or prefer not to Reap, you may pass, meaning that you are done Reaping for the Age. 

When you Reap a space, return *all* of your Acolytes on that space to your hand. If your Colossus is on that space, lay it on its side to indicate that you have already Reaped that space. Then gain the space's rewards:

1. **Gold cubes**: Gain any Gold cubes from the space, and return them to the bank. Gain one Gold for each cube.
2. **Grass Tiles**: If the space has Loot, gain it immediately.
3. **Environments**: If the space is a special environment, follow the environment's rules.

Once all players have passed, pass the Mantle to the player in first place, and begin the next Age. 

*Note*: This means that two different player could Reap the same space at Reap. 
- Suppose Mitch has three Acolytes, and John has one. Mitch Reaps the space, and gains his rewards. Now John has control of the space, and he can Reap it on his next turn.
- However, a Colossus still contributes to the Control of a space. Suppose Mitch has his Colossus there, and John has one Acolyte. Mitch Reaps the space. John cannot Reap this space, because Mitch's Colossus still controls it.

## Beginning a new Age

Reveal the next Age and read it aloud. Remove Beasts from the previous Age that are not in the new Age. Add new Beasts according to the Age card. 

Do the "Setup" step from the new Age if necessary, pass the Mantle to the left, and begin taking turns, starting with the player with the Mantle.

## Game End

At the end of the third Age, the game ends. The player with the most Gold wins.

# Movement
You have 4 Actions on your turn, and it costs 1 Action to move your Colossus or an Acolyte 1 space in any direction. Colossi and Acolytes follow the same rules for movement.
- **Exploring**: When moving into a space that has no tile on it, you will discover what is there. Draw an Environment tile from the deck you built during Setup. 
- **Road Movement**: When moving into a space that already contains your Colossus or 1 of your Acolytes, you may continue onward to any adjacent space for free. If you have your Colossus or Acolytes in multiple adjacent spaces, move long distances using just 1 Movement.
- **Spawn an Acolyte**: For the cost of 1 Movement, place an Acolyte from your hand onto your Colossus’s space. You may immediately move that Acolyte to an adjacent space for free using Road Movement.

Of course, if you ever move into an Environment that has an Arrival effect, resolve this immediately when moving into it. These take effect, even if you are just passing through them using Road Movement.

# Control
You must control spaces in order to Reap them at the end of each Age. How do you control a space?

| # of Colossi on the space| Who controls the space (in case of a tie, neither player has control) |
|----------|----------|
| No Colossus  | The player with the most Acolytes on the space. | 
| 1 Colossus   | The Colossus supersedes all Acolytes. | 
| Multiple Colossi   | The Colossus on the space who has the most Acolytes on the space. |
