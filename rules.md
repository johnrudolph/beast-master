# Introduction

You are one of the Colossi who rules over this dangerous island. The money grubbing gods have decided to let one of you leave this island to join their ranks — but only if you have the Gold to prove yourself. As a Colossus, you will create new Acolytes to do your bidding, control territory around the island, and collect Gold and Cards. But beware: Colossi also control the Beast and the Volcano, and will kill your Acolytes in a heartbeat. Prove yourself to the gods by outwitting the other Colossi, controlling territory, and collecting the most Gold.
 
# Components

## Board 
The island has 27 spaces. When the game starts, every space has either a Landmark or a Loot Token. The Beast and Colossi never leave the island.

## Colossi
You are a Colossus, and you lead a fleet of Acolytes.  Colossi cannot die, and remain on the island for the entire game.

## Acolytes
Acolytes move like Colossi, but die frequently. 
- Any time an Acolyte is on a space with the Beast, it dies. 
- Any time an Acolyte is pushed off the edge of the island or into the Volcano, it dies.
- When your Acolytes die, they return to your hand, and can be played again on future turns.

## The Beast
The Beast is a monster who terrorizes everyone on the island.
- The Beast kills all Acolytes on its space.
- When the Beast moves into your Colossus’s space, immediately move your Colossus to any adjacent space of your choice. If the Beast attacks multiple Colossi at once, resolve in order, beginning with the player whose turn it is, then proceed clockwise
- The Beast does not affect Banners.

## Gold
Win the game by collecting the most Gold.  There are 3 ways to collect Gold:
- Control spaces and raise your Banners to claim the rewards from Landmarks and Loot
- Collect 1 Gold for every opposing Acolyte you kill with a Beast Master card. 
- Receive Gold from Divine Gift cards.

## Banners
Banners indicate which player will collect rewards for a given space.
- There can only be 1 Banner on a given space: When you take Control of a space, immediately remove any opposing Banner there and replace it with one of your banners. There might be situations where you take control of a space when it is not your turn — replace Banners on these spaces even if it is not your turn.
- Only remove your Banner from a space if another player has taken control of it. If all of your Acolytes have moved off the space and it is now empty, your Banner remains in play and continues to earn rewards.
- You can reuse Banners after they return to your hand. If all of your Banners are in play when you take control of a space, you may move one of your Banners. 
- Banners are not affected by the Beast or the Volcano.

## Landmarks
Landmarks are special tiles with potentially big rewards. Raise one of your Banners on a Landmark to claim its rewards during the Scoring Phase of your turn. Rewards stack if you have Banners on multiple Landmark tiles of the same type.

## Loot Tokens
Loot gives you smaller rewards, and there is 1 Loot token on each space that is not a Landmark. Loot tokens remain in play, and can be used on every turn. There are Loot tokens that give you Colossus Cards, Beast Master cards, and Gold during the Scoring Phase of your turn.

## Colossus Cards
Colossus Cards allow you to get Gold, move Acolytes around, and gain advantages over opponents. You have a hand limit of 6 Cards including Colossus Cards and Beast Master Cards. There are 3 types of Colossus Card:

- **Action**: Move pieces around the board, get more cards, torment your opponents, and more.
- **Perk**: Gain a persistent advantage over other players. Perks stay in front of you, face-up for ongoing use. You may only have 1 Perk active at a time. 
- **Divine Gift**: Reward Colossi based on their position. These gifts go to all Colossi, so good timing is crucial.

## Beast Master Cards
These cards control Beast movement, the Volcano, and wreak havoc around the island. You may play a Beast Master card at any time, even if it is not your turn. For every opposing Acolyte you kill with a Beast Master card, collect 1 Gold.

- If you play a Beast Master card at the same time as other players, resolve in order beginning with the Colossus taking their turn and continuing clockwise.
- You can play a Beast Master card during another player’s turn (for example, you could play it between two of their moves). If there is a dispute about whether you played a Beast Master card before or after a Colossus moved or played a card, the Colossus gets priority and resolves their card or movement before you resolve your Beast Master card. 
- If you play a Beast Master card while someone is still resolving movements from a card that has already been played, let them finish resolving it before resolving your Beast Master card.

# Setup

- Shuffle the Colossus Card deck and the Beast Master Card deck, and place each of them near the board. Deal each player 3 Colossus Cards and 1 Beast Master card
- Each player chooses a color, and receives a set of 1 Colossus, 5 Banners, and 10 Acolytes of that color (in a 3 player game, each player gets 12 Acolytes)
- Place the 8 Landmark tiles around the Board. For your first game, use the configuration shown here. For future games, we suggest players choose the location of Landmarks. In this case, stack all 8 Tiles, shuffle them, then take turns drawing Tiles and placing each Tile in any empty space other than the center space.
- Place 1 random Loot Token in each space that is not a Landmark, until every space on the Board has either a Landmark Tile or a Loot Token.
- Place the Beast in the center space of the Board.
- Determine a first player. Take turns making initial Colossus placements: place your Colossus in any space other than the Volcano or the Beast’s space, then immediately places 3 of your Acolytes on or adjacent to your Colossus’s space (Acolytes do not need to be on 1 space).

# Gameplay

Beast Master takes place over 6 Ages. An Age is complete when every player has taken 1 turn. Determine a first player, then take turns. 

## Colossus Turn

A Colossus Turn has 3 phases:
1. Drawing Phase: Draw 1 Colossus Card.
2. Action Phase: In any order, you may move your Colossus and Acolytes up to 4 times and play up to 2 Colossus Cards from your hand. Any time you take Control of a space, immediately discard any Banner there and replace it with one of your Banners.
3. Scoring Phase: When you are finished playing, collect Loot and Landmark rewards from any space you’ve claimed with your Banners.

## Game End

The winner is the Colossus with the most Gold at the end of the game. The game ends when you have completed the 6 Ages. Beast Master can also be played in a Half Cycle (4 Ages instead of 6). Half Cycles are great for learning the game, or playing a quick game.

# Movement
You have 4 Movements on your turn, and it costs 1 Movement to move your Colossus or an Acolyte 1 space in any direction. Colossi and Acolytes follow the same rules for movement.
- **Road Movement**: When moving into a space that already contains your Colossus or one of your Acolytes, you may continue onward to any adjacent space for free. If you have your Colossus or Acolytes in multiple adjacent spaces, move long distances using just 1 Movement.
- **Create an Acolyte**: For the cost of 1 Movement, place an Acolyte from your hand onto your Colossus’s space. You may immediately move that Acolyte to an adjacent space for free using Road Movement.

# Control
You must control spaces in order to raise your Banners and then receive rewards from Loot and Landmarks. How do you control a space?

| # of Colossi on the space| Who controls the space (in case of a tie, neither player has control) |
|----------|----------|
| No Colossus  | The player with the most Acolytes on the space. | 
| 1 Colossus   | The Colossus supersedes all Acolytes. | 
| Multiple Colossi   | The Colossus on the space who has the most Acolytes on the space. | 

When you take Control of a space, immediately discard any opposing Banner there and replace it with one of your Banners. If all of your Banners are in play, you may move one of your Banners to that space.
