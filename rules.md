# Introduction

You are one of the Colossi who rules over this dangerous island. The money grubbing gods have decided to let one of you leave this island to join their ranks — but only if you have the Gold to prove yourself. As a Colossus, you will create new Acolytes to do your bidding, control territory around the island, and collect Gold and Cards. But beware: Colossi also control the Beast, and will kill your Acolytes in a heartbeat. Prove yourself to the gods by outwitting the other Colossi, controlling Environments, and collecting the most Gold.
 
# Components

## Board 
The island has 27 spaces. The island starts empty, but will eventually be filled with Loot Tokens and Environments.

## Colossi
You are a Colossus, and you lead a fleet of Acolytes.  Colossi cannot die, and remain on the island for the entire game.

## Acolytes
Acolytes move like Colossi, but die frequently. 
- Any time an Acolyte is on a space with the Beast, it dies. 
- Any time an Acolyte is pushed off the edge of the island, it dies.
- When your Acolytes die, they return to your hand, and can be played again on future turns.

## The Beast
The Beast is a monster who terrorizes everyone on the island.
- The Beast kills all Acolytes on its space.
- When the Beast moves into your Colossus’s space, immediately move your Colossus to any adjacent space of your choice. If the Beast attacks multiple Colossi at once, resolve in order, beginning with the player whose turn it is, then proceed clockwise

## Gold
Win the game by collecting the most Gold.  There are 3 ways to collect Gold:
- Control spaces and raise your Banners to claim the rewards from Environmnets and Loot
- Collect 1 Gold for every opposing Acolyte you kill with a Beast card. 
- Receive Gold from Divine Gift cards.

## Banners
Banners indicate which player will collect rewards for a given space.
- You can raise your Banners at the end of your turn on spaces you Control. There can only be 1 Banner on a given space. If there was an opposing Banner on the space where you raised one, return it to its owner's hand.
- Even if you move your Acolytes and Colossus off of that space, and another player Controls it, your Banner remains until they replace it or you Rest.
- If you have no Banners in your hand, you cannot play anymore Banners. You cannot move Banners already in play.
- When you Rest, you will collect rewards for each of your Banners, and return them to your hand. You can reuse Banners after they return to your hand.

## Environments
Environments are special tiles with potentially big rewards. Raise one of your Banners on a Environment to claim its rewards when you Rest.

## Loot Tokens
Loot gives you smaller rewards. Loot tokens remain in play, and can be used on every turn. There are Loot tokens that give you Colossus Cards and Gold when you Rest. Raise one of your Banners on a space with a Loot Token to claim its rewards when you Rest.

## Colossus Cards
Colossus Cards allow you to get Gold, move Acolytes around, and gain advantages over opponents. You have a hand limit of 6 Cards including Colossus Cards and Beast Cards. There are 4 types of Colossus Card:

- **Action**: Move pieces around the board, get more cards, and more.
- **Perk**: Gain a persistent advantage over other players. Perks stay in front of you, face-up for ongoing use. You may only have 1 Perk active at a time. 
- **Divine Gift**: Reward Colossi based on their position. These gifts go to all Colossi, so good timing is crucial.
- **Beast Master**: Control Beast movement, torment your opponents, re-arrange the island, and otherwise wreak havoc.

# Setup

- Each player chooses a color, and receives a set of 1 Colossus, 5 Banners, and 10 Acolytes of that color (in a 3 player game, each player gets 12 Acolytes)
- Shuffle the Colossus Card deck and place it near the board. Deal each player 3 Colossus Cards.
- Stack all Environment tiles face-down and shuffle them.
- Shuffle all Loot Tokens and place them face-down.
- Place the Beast in the center space of the Board.
- Determine a first player. 

# Gameplay

Colossi's gameplay simply consists of player turns. Continue taking turns until each player has taken 15 turns. 

## Colossus Turn

On your turn, do one of two things: 

1. **Take Actions**: 
- First, draw 1 Colossus Card.
- In any order, you may move your Colossus and Acolytes up to 4 times and play any number of Colossus Cards from your hand.
- At the end of your turn, you may place Banners from your hand on any spaces you Control. If you place a Banner on a space containing an opposing Banner, return it to its owner's hand.

2. **Rest**: Collect rewards from each space with one of your Banners. Resolve these in any order you choose. Return each Banner to your hand after you resolve it. 

You can only do one of the above, not both. If you take Actions, you will not collect rewards. If you rest, you will not take actions or place any Banners.

## Game End

Beast Master ends after each player has taken 15 turns. 

# Movement
You have 4 Movements on your turn, and it costs 1 Movement to move your Colossus or an Acolyte 1 space in any direction. Colossi and Acolytes follow the same rules for movement.
- **Exploring**: When moving into a space that has no Loot Token or Environment, you will discover what is there. Roll the die. If you roll 1-4, place a random Loot Token there. If you roll 5-6, place an Environment there. 
- **Road Movement**: When moving into a space that already contains your Colossus or one of your Acolytes, you may continue onward to any adjacent space for free. If you have your Colossus or Acolytes in multiple adjacent spaces, move long distances using just 1 Movement.
- **Spawn an Acolyte**: For the cost of 1 Movement, place an Acolyte from your hand onto your Colossus’s space. You may immediately move that Acolyte to an adjacent space for free using Road Movement.

# Control
You must control spaces in order to raise your Banners. How do you control a space?

| # of Colossi on the space| Who controls the space (in case of a tie, neither player has control) |
|----------|----------|
| No Colossus  | The player with the most Acolytes on the space. | 
| 1 Colossus   | The Colossus supersedes all Acolytes. | 
| Multiple Colossi   | The Colossus on the space who has the most Acolytes on the space. |
